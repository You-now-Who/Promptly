    THANK YOU FOR LISTENING ME VENT. IM GOING TO GO MAD <br/>
    HAHA, a nice simple project to make people share AI promts, I thought. <br/>
    3 hrs tops. Nothing more, I thought. <br/>
    What could go wrong? I thought. <br/>
    <br/>
    Turns out, a shit ton of stuff can go wrong. <br/>
    Next Auth just updated a month ago. <br/>
    I've never worked with Next Auth before. I didn't know how it was supposed to be. <br/>
    So once I'd spent an hour making Next Auth, I realised that something was wrong. <br/>
    Cue the debugging that took me a day and a half, several documentation and a lot of guess work. <br/>
    <br/>
    It's 3 am rn, and the thing that should have been over in hours is measured in days. <br/>
    Im so done.<br/>
    Please leave a cool prompt behind, that'll make my day and make some of this worth it.<br/>
